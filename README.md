# Position-Aided-Beam-Learning-for-Initial-Access
In this paper, beam learning based on position information (PI) about mobile station positions in the initial
access (IA) of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output cellular networks is investigated. Based on the sparse scattering of mmWave signals, the serving area is partitioned into smaller areas and the beams are learned for each small area. Moreover, the number of learned beams is restricted and fixed after learning.
Thus, the impact of position inaccuracy and blockage can be mostly mitigated and the IA delay is short in each successful IA.
